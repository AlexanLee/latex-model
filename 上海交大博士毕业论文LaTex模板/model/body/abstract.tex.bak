  In this dissertation we have made a detail investigation on spin
  Hall effect and related transport property in two-dimensional
  spin-orbital interaction electron system. Here the discussed spin Hall effect
  is in the regime of the intrinsic one which is induced by the
  spin-orbital interaction relied on the structure of the system rather than on the impurity
  scattering.

  In chapter one we review the recent theoretical and experimental
  research on the spin Hall effect and bulk spin polarization in
  spin-orbital coupling systems. We discuss the origin of the
  spin-orbital interaction in atom with both the phenomenological analysis
  and the rigorous Dirac equation, and describe the spin-orbital
  coupling in solid, especially, the Rashba coupling in chapter two.
  And finally we give the eigen energies and eigen states for Rashba
  system. In chapter three the definition of the spin current and
  some related problem are discussed. By using the conventional
  definition, we first calculate the spin-Hall conductivity without
  impurity, and then consider the system in the diffusive regime.

  We discuss the properties of the linear Rashba system in the
  presence of the THz optical field in chapter four. For high frequency situation
  the clean assumption is valid, we discuss the system without
  impurity. We find that the spin-Hall current oscillates with
  the frequency of the THz field and its amplitude is
  influenced by the optical intensity. We observe the nonlinearity
  between the spin-Hall current amplitude and the optical intensity,
  amplitude may reach a maximum and then decrease. These feature may provide a different
way to control the spin polarization and the spintronic devices
optically in nonmagnetic semiconductors. Since the oscillated spin
current is directly related to the bulk spin polarization, this
provides a direct method to study the relationship between the
traditional spin current density and the experimental measurement.

Since the precise cancellation of spin-Hall conductivity in the
Rashba model of two dimensional electron systems occurs only for the
parabolic energy spectrum, in chapter five we consider the
nonparabolic situation. For nonparabolic Kane dispersion, we find
that the cancellation effect from the spin-dependent part of the
ladder current vertex in the Born approximation for impurity
scattering will not occur. The total spin Hall conductivity is
finite and its value not only relates to the nonparabolic degree of
the electron energy dispersion but also strongly depends on the
smoothness of the disorder, and it increases with the increasing
electron density. The overshoot phenomena analogous with the one of
charge current is observed for the transient situation.

In chapter six, we discuss other properties of this Rashba system by
the balance equation approach. In the case of realistic impurity and
phonon scatterings, the longitudinal conductivity is shown to depend
on the spin-orbital coupling strength, though the transverse
conductivity remains zero. The nonlinear effect of spin-orbital
coupling on the $y$ component of the spin polarization is observed,
while the other components still vanish. At high temperatures, the
phonon scattering has an impact on the suppression of the mobility
peak and the spin polarization. In the nonlinear case, we find that
the spin-orbital coupling may enhance the electron cooling, a clear
saturation of spin polarization appears at high electric field, and
the maximum $y$ component of spin polarization the system can reach
is limited by the spin-split strength. These features are in
qualitative agreement with experimental results. We have also
studied the effect of nonparabolicity due to Rashba coupling and
find that it plays an appreciable role for low density and strong
spin-orbital coupling system.

The last chapter gives the conclusion and outlook of this
dissertation.
